DomainTools whois plugin shows whois data for domains found in blog articles and links them to whois.domaintools.com.

== Description ==

The DomainTools Whois plugin will automatically link domain names in a WordPress page or blog post to the DomainTools Whois service. It also generates a pop-up containing a summary of Whois information that your visitors can see without leaving your site.

== Installation ==

1. After downloading the DomainTools Domain plugin, unpack and upload the file to the wp-content/plugins folder on your blog. Make sure to leave the directory structure of the archive intact so that all of the plugin files are located in 'wp-content/plugins/domaintools-whois-plugin/'

2. You will need to activate the DomainTools domain plugin in order to see the summary data on domains. Go to the Plugins tab and find Domaintools.com Wordpress plugin in the list and click **Activate**.

3. After activating view your blog and look for places where you typed a domain name. To do further tweaks go to Settings -> Domaintools to turn specific features on and off.
